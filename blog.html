            <h2>Learn JavaScript in fun way !</h2>
            <p>
              JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that
              is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside
              HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the
              client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party
              libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript
              engine to execute the code on users' devices.

            <h2>Learn C++ in fun way !</h2>
            <p>
              C++ (pronounced "C plus plus") is a general-purpose programming
              language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup as
              an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes".

            <h2>Learn Python in fun way !</h2>
            <p>
              Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its
              design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of
              significant indentation.[33] Python is dynamically-typed and
              garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
              including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented
              and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries
              included" language due to its comprehensive standard library

            <h2>Learn Rust in fun way !</h2>
            <p>
              Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language.
              Rust emphasizes performance, type safety, and
              concurrency.[9][10][11] Rust enforces memory safety—that is, that
              all references point to valid memory—without requiring the use of
              a garbage collector or reference counting present in other
              memory-safe languages.
