            <p>
              Hi! I'm Dibyendu, born in '96.I am the only son of my parents. I
              am very connected with my mother. I spent most of my life in my
              hometown, Malda. I am a graduate in computer science & still
              pursuing my post-graduate diploma in Mass Communication &
              Journalism. I love to learn new skills and to meet with New
              Peoples. My hobbies are playing boxing, watching cricket matches,
              movies, etc. I know that I'm not perfect, so I try to learn from
              my shortcomings. I try to be a workaholic guy. I am always
              believed in time management. I believe in everything is achievable
              with the right mindset and the right strategy. I'm an
              environmentalist. I believe 'Nature is the God', if we protect
              nature then nature always protects us against any losses. I'm
              trying to update myself with new skills, and current affairs. my
              key area of interest in the Indian economy, Politics,
              International relations, Stock market, Investment, Technology,
              Environment, Defense, etc. My role models are Md. Ali, Elon musk,
              and many more. they inspire me a lot. when I feel low, I try to
              read their biography for self-motivation and always try to ask
              myself what I want in my life " the pain of regret or Pain of
              discipline".
